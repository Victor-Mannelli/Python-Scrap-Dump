# Scrap and Dump Automation Project

This project was created as part of a Python data analysis course. It serves as a proof of concept (POC) on automating manual processes using Python.

## Overview

In this project, we automate the process of entering product information into a system. Instead of manually entering each piece of information, we use Python to control mouse and keyboard inputs to perform the task automatically.

## Key Features

- Automation of data entry tasks
- Control of mouse and keyboard inputs
- Simulated login and product registration on a website

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies (if any).
- Run the automation script to simulate the data entry process.
- Monitor the automation process and review the results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyAutoGUI (for controlling mouse and keyboard)
- etc. (add any additional technologies used)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to submit a pull request.
